## üîå API Integration

The project integrates with the Bconomy API:

- **API Base URL**: `https://bconomy.net/api/data`
- **Authentication**: Uses `x-api-key` header

### API Key System

The application uses a flexible API key system:

#### Default Key
- A default API key is provided with the application
- Subject to rate limiting (150 queries/minute)
- Shared among all users who don't provide their own key

#### Personal API Key
- Users can provide their own API key through the navbar input
- To get your API key:
  1. Type `/resetapikey` in the Bconomy.net game console
  2. Copy the generated key
  3. Paste it in the API key input field in the navbar
- To revoke access: Type `/resetapikey` again in game

#### Technical Details
- API keys are stored in browser's localStorage only
- No server-side storage of user API keys
- Keys persist across browser sessions but can be cleared
- When no personal key is provided, falls back to default key automatically
